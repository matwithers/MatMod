BotLocationModifier
===================

https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/doc/entry/60-mysterious-bot-behavior-variables/

Certain Variables have an upper and lower limit (Found in 
BotDifficultySettingsClass.ApplyPreset) If it falls outside of these "if" 
statements it reverts to default

AccuracySpeed
-------------
Modifies database/bots/types/<type>.json <type><difficulty>Core.AccuratySpeed
(note typo in AccuratySpeed is correct)

AccuratySpeed runs from 0.3 for an easy skav to 0.1 for bosses and followers

Smaller is Harder !

DistToActivate
--------------
Distance a PMC needs to come within to activate a bots agression.

This runs from 100m on nightime factory to 330m on lighthouse and reserve
(have you wondered why PMC's seem to focus you from half way across the map ?)


DistToPersueAxemanCoef
----------------------


DistToSleep
-----------
Distance past which Bots will sleep (although I have read that
PMC bots and Bosses do not sleep)


GainSight
---------
Modifies database/bots/types/<type>.json <difficulty>Core.GainSightCoef

GainSight runs from 0.2 for an easy skav to 0.01 for some bosses and followers

KhorovodChance
--------------



MagnetPower
-----------


MarksmanAccuratyCoef
--------------------


Scattering
----------

VisibleDistance
---------------
Modifies database/bots/types/<type>.json <type><difficulty>Core.VisibleDistance
VisibleDistance <= 250 && >= 40

Core VisibleDistance runs from 110m for an easy skav to 392m for sturman 

VisibleDistance Modifie multiplies the Core visible distance

e.g. Core VisibleDistance = 100m Modifier VisibleDistance = 0.5

Resulting VisibleDistance = 100m * 0.5 = 50m

The location `base.json` files also have modifiers under `BotLocationModifiers`
(for example VisibleDistance on rezervbase is 1.3 so they spot you from 30% 
further away). Scavs also have ESP meaning if you target them they'll look in 
your direction (well, more or less).

When I was testing 0 VisibleDistance and 0 VisibleAngle (which *in theory* 
shouldn't be affected by multipliers cause any times 0 is 0) there were a 
few anomalies might worth being careful about:

    Some bots somehow can still beam you down (Shturman's guards killed me 
    several times from the other side of the woodcutter camp for example)

    Bots can go into revenge mode which also makes them shoot in your 
    direction (https://dev.sp-tarkov.com/SPT-AKI/Server/src/branch/development/project/assets/configs/bot.json#L174-L177)

    Flashlights seem to also give a huge boost to them being able to see you

Now admittedly this is all anecdotal but even with them being expected to be 
TOTALLY BLIND (no visibility distance or angle) they were surprisingly accurate 
sometimes (but it was quite rare.) 


// FIXME
Also Research:
VisibleAngle <= 180 && >= 50
/ <= 1.5 && > 0
